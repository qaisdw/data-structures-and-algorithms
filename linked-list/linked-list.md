# Challenge Singly Linked Lists.
**Description of the challenge**

The challenge is to implement a Linked List class with three methods:

1. insert(value): Adds a new node with the given value to the head of the list in constant time (O(1)).
2. includes(value): Returns True if a node with the given value exists in the list, otherwise False.
3. to_string(): Returns a string representation of the linked list, with each node's value enclosed in curly braces and separated by an arrow (->), ending with "NULL". For example, if the list contains nodes with values 'a', 'b', and 'c', the to_string() method should return "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL".
